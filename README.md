This project focuses on hyperspectral image (HSI) classification using both supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods on the Indian Pines dataset. It explores multiple supervised architectures including a Deep Neural Network (DNN), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), 2D CNN, and a 3D CNN using spectral-spatial patches. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the spectral dimensionality from 200 to 50 bands, enabling efficient training and reducing redundancy. The 3D CNN achieved the highest supervised classification accuracy of 99.85%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing both spatial and spectral features.

To address the challenge of limited labeled data, a self-supervised learning approach using SimCLR was implemented. The model was pretrained using contrastive learning on unlabeled data and then fine-tuned using only 20%, 40%, and 60% of labeled samples. This approach achieved validation accuracies of 80.7%, 90.87%, and 94.37% respectively, showing the strength of self-supervised representation learning in low-label scenarios. The project concludes that combining spectral-spatial deep learning with SimCLR-style contrastive pretraining offers a scalable and high-performing solution for real-world HSI classification tasks.
